## Choices

-   Choice is fundamental to human existence, ranging from daily individual decisions to major collective choices that shape society

-   Individual choices encompass:

    -   Routine decisions about time and money management
    -   Major life decisions regarding housing, family, and career paths

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Collective choices involve:

    -   Creation of laws and regulations
    -   Management of public resources
    -   Decision-making through voting or representatives

-   All choices involve trade-offs:

    -   Selecting one option means foregoing others
    -   Both individual and collective choices require evaluating alternatives based on preferences

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   People's choices reveal their preferences:
    -   Choosing an activity shows it was "worth" its cost
    -   Observed choices help understand what people value
-   Nonmarket valuation focuses on choices not captured by traditional markets:
    -   Environmental goods and services (clean air, wilderness)
    -   Natural amenities that aren't directly purchased
    -   Public resources requiring collective decision-making

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Understanding preferences helps inform policy decisions:
    -   Guides allocation of public funds
    -   Assists in evaluating environmental preservation
    -   Supports cost-benefit analysis of public projects

## Market failure and choices

-   The "invisible hand" principle has limitations:
    -   While individual choices can benefit society, this doesn't always work for environmental goods
    -   The principle assumes markets exist for all goods and services people value

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Market failures in environmental goods lead to undersupply:
    -   Without markets, providers can't receive payment for environmental benefits
    -   Private landowners lack incentives to protect habitat when they can't monetize the benefits
    -   The true social value of environmental goods isn't reflected in market transactions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Environmental externalities create economic inefficiencies:
    -   Negative externalities occur when actions harm others without compensation
    -   Companies don't pay for environmental damage, leading to excessive pollution
    -   Private costs don't include environmental impacts, distorting decision-making
-   Two solutions exist for market failures:
    -   Create new markets for environmental goods where possible
    -   Implement government interventions through regulations or direct provision

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Nonmarket valuation serves crucial roles:
    -   Helps quantify environmental benefits that markets don't capture
    -   Provides information to address market failures
    -   Supports policy decisions about environmental protection

## Non-market Valuation

-   The evolution of nonmarket valuation spans several decades:
    -   Originated in 1950s U.S. for water resource project analysis
    -   Gained momentum in 1980s through key federal actions
    -   Executive Order 12291 mandated benefit-cost analyses
    -   Environmental legislation required damage assessments

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Applications expanded to include:
    -   Environmental regulation benefit assessment
    -   Natural resource damage compensation
    -   Land and water management decisions
    -   Ecosystem services valuation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Growing recognition of ecosystem services drove wider adoption:
    -   Non-economists began showing interest
    -   Environmental degradation raised awareness
    -   Policy decisions often overlooked ecosystem value
    -   Need emerged to quantify natural benefits
-   Landmark ecosystem valuation studies emerged:
    -   1997 study estimated global ecosystem value at \$33 trillion
    -   Generated controversy and critique from economists
    -   Sparked important discussions about valuation methods
    -   Highlighted need for proper methodology

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Current state of nonmarket valuation:
    -   Serves critical role in environmental decision-making
    -   Helps quantify previously ignored natural benefits
    -   Requires careful understanding of proper techniques
    -   Continues to evolve with new applications and methods

## Values vs valuation

-   Economic valuation differentiates between two types of values:
    -   Held values: Core principles like loyalty, freedom, or environmental stewardship
    -   Assigned values: Specific valuations, such as how much someone would pay to preserve a local forest or clean up a polluted lake

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Assigned values are influenced by multiple factors:
    -   Individual perceptions: A hiker might value wilderness differently than a developer
    -   Personal held values: Someone who believes in environmental protection might assign higher value to endangered species preservation
    -   Context: The value assigned to clean air might be higher in a heavily polluted city versus a rural area
    -   External circumstances: Income levels affect how much people can pay for environmental improvements

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Nonmarket valuation specifically focuses on:
    -   Measuring assigned values: Quantifying how much people value improving air quality from level A to B
    -   Relative changes: Comparing outcomes like having a protected wetland versus developing it
    -   Practical examples: Determining the value of preserving a national park or reducing water pollution in a river
    -   Trade-off decisions: Whether to spend \$20 million on forest preservation or a new museum

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Key principles of environmental valuation:
    -   Values are relative: Clean air is valued against current pollution levels
    -   Specific outcomes: Preserving 1,000 acres of wetland versus abstract environmental protection
    -   Practical applications: Assessing damages from oil spills or benefits of emissions regulations
    -   Real-world choices: Deciding between expanding a highway or protecting adjacent wildlife habitat

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Economic approach to valuation:
    -   Real-world applications: Evaluating compensation for environmental damage from chemical spills
    -   Policy decisions: Determining appropriate pollution control standards
    -   Project assessment: Analyzing costs and benefits of dam construction
    -   Resource management: Deciding optimal harvest levels for fisheries or forests

## Concept of value

-   Economic theory defines value through trade-offs:
    -   Value = Maximum amount one would give up to gain something
    -   Example: How much money someone would sacrifice to preserve a local park
    -   Negative values exist too: Compensation required to accept pollution

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Two key principles of economic value:
    -   Higher willingness to sacrifice indicates higher value
    -   Example: If someone would pay ₹100 to save forest A but only ₹50 for forest B, they value A more
    -   Values can be compared by measuring sacrifice amounts
    -   Example: Choosing between ₹20M for air quality improvement or water cleanup

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Trade-offs can be measured in different ways:
    -   Monetary terms (most common): Rupees willing to pay
    -   Risk trade-offs: Accepting one risk to reduce another
    -   Example: Accepting slightly higher traffic risk to reduce flood risk
    -   Time trade-offs: Hours willing to volunteer for environmental cleanup
-   Key economic value concepts:
    -   Willingness to Pay (WTP): Amount someone would pay for improvement
    -   Example: ₹50 monthly for cleaner air
    -   Willingness to Accept (WTA): Compensation required to give up something
    -   Example: ₹1000 to accept loss of neighborhood green space

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Benefits in economic valuation:
    -   Specifically means monetary value assigned
    -   Allows comparison across different projects
    -   Enables cost-benefit analysis
    -   Example: ₹5M benefit from wetland preservation versus ₹3M cost

## The Valuation Process

-   Six Key Steps in Environmental Valuation:

    -   Step 1: Problem Formulation

    -   Example: Evaluating dam removal options for river restoration

    -   Identify alternatives like full removal, partial removal, fish ladders

    -   Step 2: Identify Environmental Changes

    -   Example: Changes in water flow, fish population, habitat quality

    -   Map out all potential biophysical impacts

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Step 3: Link to Human Well-being

-   Example: Improved fishing opportunities (₹5000 annual value)

-   Consider both use and passive-use values

-   Include cultural and ecological benefits

-   Step 4: Quantify Changes

-   Example: 40% increase in fish population

-   Measure impacts in concrete, measurable terms

-   Focus on changes relevant to human welfare

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Step 5: Estimate Economic Values

-   Example: Calculate willingness to pay for improvements

-   Use appropriate valuation methods

-   Consider both direct and indirect benefits

-   Step 6: Communicate Results

-   Present findings to decision-makers

-   Clearly explain methodology and assumptions

-   Support informed policy choices

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Important Process Characteristics:
    -   Iterative rather than linear
    -   Requires interdisciplinary collaboration
    -   Must link scientific measures to human values
    -   Example: Can't just measure phytoplankton changes without connecting to human benefits
-   In moving from conceptualizing the valuation process described above to actually estimating values (benefits) using nonmarket valuation, a number of issues can arise.

## Issue 1: Whose value to include

-   Defining the Relevant Population:
    -   Cannot simply include everyone who values a change
    -   Must consider specific context and purpose
    -   Population scope affects total valuation significantly
-   Compensation Scenarios:
    -   Legal entitlement determines relevant population
    -   Example: Oil spill compensation
    -   Local impacts: Affected fishermen claiming ₹50,000 each
    -   Broader impacts: Public claims for wildlife damage
    -   Must define "public" - local, national, or global

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Policy Evaluation Contexts:
    -   Greenhouse gas emission reduction example:
    -   National benefits: ₹500M in reduced climate impacts
    -   Global benefits: ₹10B in worldwide impact reduction
    -   Choice depends on policy objectives
-   Key Decision Factors:
    -   Policy objectives: Local vs global benefits
    -   Cost bearing: Who pays for implementation
    -   Example: If country bears ₹1B cost:
        -   Local benefits only: May not justify cost
        -   Global benefits included: May justify cost

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Important Considerations:
    -   Decision-maker perspective matters
    -   Geographic scope affects benefit calculations
    -   Need clear criteria for population inclusion
    -   Balance between costs and beneficiary scope

## Issue 2: Aggregating values accross individuals

-   Aggregating Individual Values:
    -   Standard method: Simple addition across population
    -   Example: If 1000 people value a park at ₹500 each = ₹500,000 total
    -   Typically uses unweighted summation
    -   Alternative: Voting-based preference aggregation
        -   Drawback: do not reflect the intensity of individual preferences for one option over another.
        -   For example, in a three-person vote, an option that is only slightly preferred by two individuals would win over an option that is strongly preferred by the third individual.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Maximizing **aggregate net benefits** (or **total income**) is **not always** the same as maximizing **total utility**.\
-   The two are equivalent **only if** income is redistributed to equalize **marginal utility of income (MUY)** across individuals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Let $Y_i(x)$ be income of **Person i**, where $i = 1,2$.\
-   Let $u_i(Y_i(x))$ be the **utility function** of Person i.\
-   If **Person 1 gains** while **Person 2 loses**, then:\
    $$
    \frac{\partial Y_1}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial Y_2}{\partial x} > 0
     $$ → **Total income increases (benefit \> cost).**\
-   However, if **marginal utility of income** differs:\
    $$
    \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial Y_1} < \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial Y_2}
     $$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then:\
$$
  \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial Y_1} \frac{\partial Y_1}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial Y_2} \frac{\partial Y_2}{\partial x} < 0
 $$\
→ **Total utility decreases, despite net income gain.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Suppose **Policy X** increases **Person 1’s** income by **₹1000** but decreases **Person 2’s** income by **₹800**.\
-   **Net income gain**:\
    $$
    1000 - 800 = \text{₹200} > 0
     $$
-   However, if **Person 1** is **wealthy** and **Person 2** is **poor**, then:\
    $$
    MU_{Y_1} < MU_{Y_2}
     $$\
-   **Loss in utility** for **Person 2** may exceed the **gain** for **Person 1**, leading to an overall **reduction in aggregate utility**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Within a generation**, taxes and subsidies can correct disparities.\
-   **Across generations**, redistribution is harder, affecting long-term **cost-benefit analysis**.\
-   Hence, **ignoring marginal utility differences** across individuals is common in static analysis but **crucial** in **intergenerational welfare analysis**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Income Effect Challenges:
    -   Higher income leads to higher willingness to pay
    -   Example:
        -   Wealthy person values clean air at ₹10,000
        -   Low-income person values same at ₹2,000
        -   Same preferences but different ability to pay

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Equal Weighting Issues:
    -   Appears fair but has implications
    -   Benefits skew toward wealthy populations
    -   Example:
        -   Two identical parks
        -   Wealthy area shows ₹10M total benefit
        -   Poor area shows ₹2M total benefit
        -   May lead to biased decision-making

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Key Considerations:
    -   Need to understand wealth bias in results
    -   Consider distributional impacts
    -   Provide decision-makers with:
        -   Total unweighted benefits
        -   Distribution across income groups
        -   Social equity implications
-   Alternative Approaches:
    -   Weighted aggregation possible
    -   Can incorporate distributional concerns
    -   Must be transparent about methodology
    -   Consider generational equity issues

## Issue 3:Aggregating Benefits Across Time

-   **Importance of Time in Benefit Calculation**\
-   Policies (e.g., **climate change mitigation**) generate benefits over **multiple time periods**.\
-   **Total benefit** = sum of **current and future benefits**.\
-   Future benefits must be appropriately **weighted** when compared to present benefits.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Standard approach: **Discounting** using a **discount factor**.\
-   Total **discounted benefit** over time:\
    $$
    B = \sum_{t=0}^{T} \frac{B_t}{(1+r)^t}
    $$ where:\
    -$B_t$ = Benefit in period $t$\
    -$r$ = Discount rate\
    -$T$ = Total time horizon

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Why Discount Future Benefits?**\

1.  **Investment-based rationale:**
    -   Money today can be **invested** to earn returns.\
    -   Example:
        -   ₹100 today at **5% interest** → ₹105 next year.\
        -   **Hence, ₹105 next year is worth ₹100 today.**\
        -   Future payments should be **discounted** to reflect this.
2.  **Consumption-based rationale:**
    -   **Diminishing Marginal Utility of Consumption (MUY)**\
    -   **Example:** If future generations are richer, an extra ₹1000 will be **less valuable** to them than to us today.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Intergenerational Equity & Discounting**\
-   Should future generations be valued **equally**?\
-   If yes: **Equal utility weights** across generations.\
-   If future generations are **richer**, their benefits may be discounted:\
    $$
    \text{Higher consumption } \Rightarrow \text{Lower marginal utility } \Rightarrow \text{Discounting justified}
    $$\
-   Policy decisions should **balance** equity and economic growth.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Practical Approach to Discounting**\
-   **Uncertainty in discount rates** → Use a **declining discount rate** over time.\
-   Standard practice: **Compute benefits for multiple discount rates** (e.g., **2%, 4%, 6%**) to capture variations.

## **Issue 4: Uncertainty in Valuing Environmental Changes**

-   **Sources of Uncertainty**\
-   **Uncertainty in predicting environmental changes** (e.g., climate change impact).\
-   **Uncertainty in assigning values** to environmental changes.\
-   Example: Policy to **reduce greenhouse gas emissions** → uncertainty in:
    -   **Emissions reduction effectiveness**\
    -   **Climate impact of emission reductions**\
    -   **Effects on health, agriculture, and ecosystems**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Role of Models in Predicting Outcomes**\
-   Use of models introduces **structural and parameter uncertainty**.\
-   Uncertainty exists in:
    -   **Future economic conditions** (income, preferences).\
    -   **Preferences of future generations**.\
-   Values assigned to outcomes reflect these uncertainties.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Incorporating Uncertainty in Economic Valuation**\
-   Economic value under uncertainty is based on **expected utility**:\
    $$
    EV = \sum P_i U(Y_i)
    $$ where:
    -   $P_i$ = Probability of outcome $i$\
    -   $U(Y_i)$ = Utility from income level $Y_i$.\
-   Individuals’ **risk preferences** influence valuation:
    -   **Risk-averse:** Higher value on certainty.\
    -   **Risk-neutral:** Value based purely on expected return.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Techniques to Address Uncertainty**\
-   **Sensitivity analysis**: Examining how variations in key parameters affect results.
    -   Example: Evaluating a Carbon Tax Policy Suppose the government implements a carbon tax to reduce emissions.
        -   Key uncertain factors:
            -   Elasticity of demand for fossil fuels (How much will consumption decrease as price increases?).
            -   Cost of renewable energy alternatives (How competitive are they?).
            -   Economic growth rate (Affects future emissions and policy impact).
        -   Method:
            -   Run the cost-benefit analysis with different values for each variable.
            -   Identify how sensitive the net benefits are to changes in assumptions.
        -   If small changes in a parameter (e.g., renewable energy cost) drastically alter the policy's net benefits, the policy outcome is highly sensitive to that factor.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Monte Carlo simulation**: Running multiple simulations to estimate probability distributions of outcomes.
    -   Example: Predicting Future Economic Losses from Flooding A city wants to estimate economic damages from future floods due to climate change.
        -   Key uncertain variables:
            -   Future sea level rise (Varies due to climate uncertainty).
            -   Storm intensity (More extreme weather events are likely).
            -   Property values (Higher values mean greater damages).
        -   Method:
            -   Assign probability distributions to these variables (e.g., sea level rise follows a normal distribution).
            -   Run 10,000 simulations, each time drawing random values for variables.
            -   Analyze the distribution of projected damages.
        -   Instead of predicting one single damage estimate, the city gets a probability range (e.g., ₹500 crore to ₹2000 crore, with a 70% chance of exceeding ₹1000 crore).
-   **Surveys**: Eliciting public values for uncertain environmental outcomes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Valuing Risk Reduction**\
-   Some policies **explicitly aim to reduce risk** (e.g., air pollution policies).\
-   Example: Reducing **PM2.5 pollution** lowers risk of:
    -   **Asthma**\
    -   **Infant mortality**\
-   Economic value of risk reduction estimated via **willingness to pay (WTP)**:\
    $$
    WTP = \sum P_i (U(Y_i^*) - U(Y_i))
    $$ where $Y_i^*$ is improved health outcome due to policy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Challenges in Nonmarket Valuation of Uncertainty**\
-   **Health risks** are easier to value than broad environmental risks.\
-   Long-term, geographically broad, or **catastrophic risks** (e.g., climate disasters) remain difficult to quantify.\
-   Need for **advanced valuation methods** to incorporate uncertainty effectively.

## Valuation Methods

-   **Revealed Preference vs. Stated Preference Methods**\
-   **Revealed Preference Methods**: Infer values from actual market behavior.\
-   **Stated Preference Methods**: Rely on survey responses to hypothetical scenarios.

| **Revealed Preference Methods** | **Stated Preference Methods** |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Travel Cost Method              | Contingent Valuation          |
| Hedonic Pricing                 | Attribute-Based Methods       |
| Defensive Behavior              | Hypothetical Substitution     |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Revealed Preference Methods**

**1. Travel Cost Method (TCM)**\
- Used for valuing **recreational sites** by analyzing how much people spend to visit.\
- **Example**: Estimating the value of a national park by considering travel costs (fuel, time, entry fees).

**2. Hedonic Pricing Method (HPM)**\
- Estimates the value of environmental attributes based on their impact on **market prices** (e.g., real estate).\
- **Example**: Comparing property prices in areas with different air pollution levels to measure the implicit value of clean air.

**3. Defensive Behavior Method**\
- Measures how much people spend to **avoid environmental harm**.\
- **Example**: The cost of water filters in areas with polluted drinking water helps estimate the value of clean water.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Stated Preference Methods**

**1. Contingent Valuation Method (CVM)**\
- Uses surveys to directly ask individuals about their **willingness to pay (WTP)** for an environmental good.\
- **Example**: Asking citizens how much they would pay for a program to reduce air pollution in Delhi.

**2. Attribute-Based Methods**\
- Uses hypothetical choices between different scenarios to estimate preferences.\
- **Example**: Presenting people with different combinations of **fuel types, vehicle prices, and emission levels** to estimate the value of reduced pollution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Choosing the Right Method**\
-   **Regulatory Needs**: Major policies may require more **rigorous** valuation methods.\
-   **Cost vs. Accuracy**: Stated preference methods may be **cheaper**, but revealed preference methods are often **more reliable**.\
-   **Combinations of Methods**: Sometimes multiple methods are used to get a **more complete valuation**.
